Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony,PSP,"dungeon siege was a big success on pc and the publisher intends to repeat the operation on psp with an entirely new opus. the latter obviously takes up the heroic fantasy context and the principle of the original title, but it is a completely new adventure that we are offered and gameplay that has been deeply revised to take into account the specificities of sony's portable console. and the least we can say is that the whole thing is rather successful. role-playing take-two interactive"

Dungeon Siege III,PS3,"dungeon siege may well be a recognized series in the field of hack'n slash, but it is far from having the aura of diablo. it must be said that if the first episode, designed by chris taylor and the gas powered games team, was well received, this was not really the case for its sequel, which was quite disappointing. so, if dungeon siege has been talked about in recent years, it's more for its film adaptation made by uwe boll. entrusted to obsidian, does the third part allow the series to definitively establish itself as a sure value of the genre? role-playing square enix"

Dungeons,PC,"passed into the hands of electronic arts following the acquisition of bullfrog, the dungeon keeper license has never resurfaced since the studio closed. 2 years ago, a trademark registration had raised the hope that ea would begin work on the third episode of the series, but it was obviously a false alarm. never mind: realmforge studios (ceville) has decided to meet fans' expectations by offering them a variant of this famous management game. dungeons borrows its mechanisms quite extensively and even part of its title. a carbon copy? not really. strategy kalypso media"

Dynasty Tactics 2,PS2,"surprising all the same to see that the dynasty series is exported so easily from japan, and what's more to france and translated into the language of molière! the first episode having benefited, among other things, from good press, it was logical to see the second episode of the saga unfold. that being said, rejoice because this episode is as gripping and even richer than the first dynasty tactics. strategy tecmo koei"

Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2,PS3,"we have known for a long time that the japanese are fans of mechas. this probably explains why they can't resist the urge to put them in every sauce. at the end of 2007, we found the steel monsters of mobile suit gundam in a disappointing crossover between the famous anime and the dynasty warriors series. and they return today in a practically identical sequel but much richer in terms of content. action namco bandai games"

Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends,PS2,"this dynasty warriors 4 xtreme legends starts from a rather paradoxical concept (which is to make something new out of something old) or at least tendentious. it is undeniable that koei's series, since the first episode, has managed to wonderfully combine mass action while integrating slight (but very slight) strategy data. in parallel with this quality inherent in each episode, the negative point has always been the absence of difference (or at least of notable evolution) between each segment. today, koei is taking the next step by releasing this dw4 xtreme legends which is to be taken not as a new opus but as an add-on to the 4th episode. action tecmo koei"

Dynasty Warriors 8,PS3,"big budget games are regularly criticized for lacking originality and always serving us the same soup. rest assured, this is not the prerogative of triple a titles, niche games also know how to handle the delicate art of recycling very well. this is for example the case of the dynasty warriors series which always manages to bring together a small community of fierce fans while each of its episodes seems to invite us on a journey into the past. dynasty warriors 8 is not going to shake up this old habit. action tecmo koei"
Dynasty Warriors Advance,GBA,"obviously, this end of the year is in a way the period for dynasty warriors eggs to hatch. indeed, after the rather chaotic arrival into the world of the hyper version, its little brother tastes the joys of the open air. soberly called advance, this one shows much less present desires for grandeur, confining itself to revealing its war in a small gba. does this mean that intensity is no longer up to date or that furious madness is shamefully hidden? all we can say is that surprise is not necessarily always the best attack. action nintendo"
Dynasty Warriors DS: Fighter's Battle,DS,"the faithful of the dynasty warriors saga risk falling from a height with this episode which is released exclusively on the ds, and which is not likely to reconcile us with koei's beat'em all. it's all the more a shame as we could have expected better for a first appearance on this medium, but we have to face the facts, the result is simply heartbreaking. action tecmo koei"

OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast,PSP,"outrun is one of those series that can pride itself on having followed the evolution of video games without ever completely disappearing. although this saga does not have as many episodes as that, it at least has the merit of having been able to calmly approach the shift by using technological advances and thus the new generations of consoles. the genesis of outrun 2006 is, however, a little different since it roughly repeats the content of outrun 2 released on xbox in 2004. racing sega"
Overlord,PC,"after having wisely learned from the age of wonders series, a brilliant, uninhibited remake of heroes of might and magic, triumph studio continues with a slightly more personal work. because overlord is presented by its creators as a demolition enterprise, a blunt pastiche of the stupefying sub-tolkieneries with which video games have fed us since the dawn of time (age of wonders included, by the way). and so as not to be accused of doing things like the others, the developers have opted for an atypical gameplay, a sort of beat'em all haloed with pikmin-style micromanagement. despite the undeniable success of this mixture, there is still little chance that overlord will be a landmark, the fault of which is too glaring. we will rather appreciate it as an excellent refreshment, which we will politely forget as soon as the summer period is over. strategy codemasters"

Overlord: Raising Hell,PS3,"a year has passed since the release of overlord on pc and xbox 360. this original and humorous title offered us a reversal of the usual roles by making us play an evil lord accompanied by his horde of evil creatures. all with atypical gameplay, a sort of improbable (but successful) mix between beat'em all and pikmin-style micro-management. the past year was used by triumph studio to refine its baby, notably by providing it with an extension: raising hell, but also to develop a playstation 3 version which therefore logically benefits from this new content. action codemasters"

Pac-Man World Rally,PS2,"despite his great age, the tireless pac-man has lost none of his former enthusiasm, and he proves it to us by getting on his brand new kart to challenge his friends in races where anything goes. pac-man rally is therefore an episode which no longer has anything to do with the other parts of the series, and even less with the arcade classic, surfing as best it can on the mario kart-like wave. racing namco bandai games"
Pac-Man World 2,PS2,"when namco brings pac-man out of the drawer, it's not simply to please nostalgic people. with pac-man world 2, the japanese publisher proves that we can still surprise with a concept that has been around for ages. the proof with this surprisingly nice title. action namco bandai games"

Pac-Pix,DS,"with games such as yoshi touch & go, wario ware and pac-pix, the nintendo ds proves that it has the means to amaze us by inspiring the genius of developers who stop at nothing to imagine innovative, crazy and terribly effective. a perfect example of a game that doesn't look like much, pac-pix will still have you glued to the screen of your ds to the point of tattooing the stylus mark on the palm of your hand! puzzle namco bandai games"

Persona 4: Arena,PS3,"a priori, what could be more different than a turn-based role-playing game and a fighting game? however, it is the great gap between the two genres that the persona series has just achieved. if this megami tensei spin-off was for the moment reserved for fans of japanese role-playing games with a slightly convoluted plot, it now returns to us in the form of a supercharged fighting game. do you think the bet is risky? that's without counting on the know-how of the little guys at arc system works who are behind this project. fighting atlus"

Serious Sam II,PC,"he's back, and he's not happy. well actually yes, but we don't care about his moods, all that concerns us is that sam, like mathilde in the song, has come back. so ""my heart stop repeating that sam, who came back, is more beautiful than before the summer. my heart, stop rattling around, remember that sam, who came back, tore you apart ."" shooter take-two interactive"
Serious Sam 3: BFE,PC,"while many fps games these days appeal more to your contemplative tendencies than to your reflexes, that wasn't always the case. and let's be clear, it certainly won't be with this expected return of sam stone in a new serious sam which will develop nothing more in you than your reptilian brain. shooter mastertronic"
Seven Samurai 20XX,PS2,"largely inspired by the film seven samurai by akira kurosawa, and moreover produced in collaboration with the latter's production company, seven samurai 20xx presents us with a more futuristic rereading of the thing. more futuristic but also less attractive. action sega"
Shadow Hearts,PS2,"overshadowed by the big ps2 releases in march, shadow hearts will certainly not have benefited from all the attention it rightly deserved, and is likely to go completely unnoticed upon its release. the time has therefore come for us to right this injustice by lifting the curtain on this surprisingly effective software, which ranks in the category of japanese rpg in the pure tradition of final fantasy. role-playing midway games"
Shadow Hearts: Covenant,PS2,"those who tried the first shadow hearts know to what extent aruze's rpg is a ufo in the video game landscape. based on an atmosphere close to a survival horror while benefiting from an absolutely brilliant combat system, because it is based on strategy and reflexes, this title has strongly marked people's minds. if the third episode is now already in preparation, here comes the second episode of this fabulous series, and in french please, all thanks to midway. role-playing midway games"

Shadow of Rome,PS2,"this beginning of the year promises to be splendid for capcom. between the phenomenal resident evil 4 on gamecube and the highly anticipated devil may cry 3 on ps2, the japanese company makes us wait using this shadow of rome, developed by part of the teams responsible for the onimusha saga. not having benefited from an information campaign as important as the two games aforementioned, shadow of rome is however a title to not underestimate. first of all, his background takes advantage of a whole section of the history of the old continent capable of giving the game an epic breath. then, as it is customary with most capcom productions, the player will face properly mind -blowing passages, the gigantism of certain fights alternating with very clever ideas. it is a fact, when the japanese attack the all -powerful rome, the trumpets resonate, the swords fall and the heads fall. action capcom"
Shadow of the Colossus,PS2,"many of you must remember ico's poetic-macabre quest, where the very notions of interactivity disappeared in favor of simple feeling. feeling yorda's fear, probing her heart with irregular and clumsy beats, listening to her complaint with a shivering concern for protection. all these sensations were to lead to one of the most disturbing experiences tackled in video games. a sort of sudden light in a relatively stereotypical landscape, ueda's work seemed to end with an enigma, a touching unsaid opening only onto a kind of lovely sadness. shadow of the colossus is in some ways the materialization of this. all of these buried feelings resurface here with a disarming power, giving this title an aura that is relatable. action sony computer entertainment"
Shadows of the Damned,PS3,"when the creators of resident evil and no more heroes team up to create a new license, it would be completely heresy not to be interested in the project. this amazing team ended up giving birth to shadows of the damned, an action horror game with a rather crazy style. action electronic arts"
Shaman King: Power of Spirit,PS2,"when you don't really know what to do on a dull, wan saturday, but you do know where to find access to satellite television and a packet of vinegar-shallot chips, it's not uncommon to come across uninteresting, or even quite bad, shows. however, on rare occasions, it happens that you come across surprising things. it was in such conditions that i met shaman king one beautiful rainy day and that i remained in contact with him for too many minutes, totally apathetic. so yes, it's big shônen that's tough, yes some of the dialogue feels reheated and yes some characters are caricatures, but, strangely, we get attached to them. perhaps thanks to the atmosphere, or to the charismatic speakers who couldn't be more ""alive"". there's definitely some magic in there. it's a shame, i would have seen the rest. adventure konami digital entertainment"

Shaun White Snowboarding: World Stage,Wii,"ubisoft intends to build on its shaun white license by already offering us a second opus in the series on wii. the first part released last year pleasantly surprised us and this sequel clearly follows in the footsteps of its big brother. for the occasion, we find similar gameplay and exactly the same graphic universe. should we therefore conclude that this shaun white snowboarding: world stage lacks new features? sports ubisoft"

Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga,PS2,"the world of rpg has sometimes tended to be carried by some of its old demons, in particular the absence of originality in the themes addressed. if we base ourselves on the latest releases and apart from a few small rebels, it is easy to note that many productions cling desperately to the concept of great destructive bad guy who seeks to put an oriented world to his boot heroic-fantasy. if this does not play against the high intrinsic quality of the titles in question, like ff iii on ds or draque 8 on ps2, it is still more than pleasant to find a convincing novelty, an originality of tone that makes you want to 'invest. this is what digital devil saga can do. role-playing ghostlight"
Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2,PS2,"seven months will have passed between the release of the first and second opus of digital devil saga. seven months of biting our nails to finally discover the sequel and end of this apocalyptic epic split into two volumes. but as someone else would say, everything comes in time to those who wait. thus, if the doors of the infernal eden seem indeed closed to the inhabitants of junkyard, an embryo of hope is still permitted. the world as we knew it no longer exists, the ashes have fallen, the wind no longer blows but there is still time to rewrite history. role-playing ghostlight"
Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne,PS2,"although two years separate us from the japanese release of lucifer's call, atlus' rpg nevertheless retains its storyline qualities as well as its game system which draws on the roots of a saga that is part of japanese video game heritage. if we europeans are not yet accustomed to the dungeon-rpg (despite the masterpiece of level 5 dark chronicle), this episode of megaten will be able to reconcile you with the genre, especially after the dot hack stampede. featuring a surprising gallery of characters while enjoying a confusing atmosphere, this rpg stands out on its own, thanks to many well-thought-out ideas and interesting construction. role-playing ghostlight"

Shrek SuperSlam,DS,"shrek and the video game is a sort of great romantic-dramatic vaudeville. they look for each other, cross paths, but when they meet, it is always with a rather unfortunate result. the thing could be comical, but it turns into drama to the extent that this duo is nothing like laurel and hardy and the one who bears the brunt, well, it's you. ah! ah! action activision"
Shrek SuperSlam,PS2,"shrek has long since earned its stripes as a big, juicy greenish franchise. it is therefore logical to find various video games alongside the new films concocted in the dreamworks factories. although the developers understood that they could, and should, play on the humorous, ironic and parodic aspect of this universe, they often tend to favor form over substance. certainly, shrek enjoys a colorful universe which allows a rereading of many genres (heroic fantasy, the world of chivalry, cinema, etc.) but what we must not lose sight of is that the primary purpose of a video game is to entertain us without hassle, without us being forced to complain every ten seconds because of poorly calibrated gameplay. unfortunately, shrek: superslam still has a long way to go to live up to what was said just before. action activision"
Shrek 2,PS2,"as the dreamworks film prepares to be released in theaters, it is not surprising to see the video game adaptation of shrek arriving. the good news is that for once, the green ogre will not serve as an alibi for a game of odious inadequacy. well, that doesn't mean it will be a hit unfortunately. platform activision"

Silent Hill 3,PS2,"""if you look long in the abyss, the abyss also looks in you."" never series of video games is never better at this quote from nietzche friedrich than that of silent hill. with this third opus, konami definitively sets the grounds for a large saga which continues to evolve while however restricting itself to a universe common to all games, a small american seaside resort, a true anteroom of hell. if the third episode is still in clear rupture compared to silent hill 2, it is nonetheless as scary and terrifying as its big brothers and is also intended to be completely inseparable from silent hill premier by the name. chronicles of a ""little"" game for great anxieties. action konami digital entertainment"

Star Wars: The Force Unleashed,PS2,"while lucasarts took care of the new gen versions, it was krome studios (the very average hellboy: the science of evil) which developed the ps2 version of star wars: the force unleashed. in fact, apart from a different level design and a few additional levels, this version is almost similar to its big sisters. however, there are unfortunately several problems missing from the xbox 360 and ps3 versions. action lucasarts"
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed,PS3,"as paradoxical as it may seem, star wars fans are not necessarily the first defenders of george lucas. thus, his involvement in the power of the force was enough to raise some very legitimate questions. but let's be reassured because if the scenario of the title strives above all to copy and paste the most famous scenes of the saga while bringing one of the greatest events to have shaken the galaxy very, very far away, we still have before all things a flamboyant and unwinding beat'em all. for the rest, all the answers you will find in the test below. action lucasarts"
